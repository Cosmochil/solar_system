                  <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth,
                     and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun,
                     Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.

                    <p>Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction most planets do.
                      Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system—with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.

                      <p>The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.
                      </p>
                      <p>This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps and weather and canyons and extinct volcanoes, evidence of an even more active past.
                        Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.
                        NASA currently has three spacecraft in orbit, one rover and one lander on the surface and another rover under construction here on Earth.
                        India and ESA also have spacecraft in orbit above Mars.
                        These robotic explorers have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.

                            <p>It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode.
                              Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III.
                              Instead the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Bode.

                                to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery.
                                In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.
